Blades in the Dark is a game about scoundrels and heists in a setting with steampunk and supernatural horror elements. While heavily inspired by the **PbtA** ( Powered by the Apacolypse ) game system, Blades in the Dark created it's own popular game system which many other story games use. Those games are refer to as **FitD** ( Forge in the Dark ).
