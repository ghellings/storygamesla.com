_Dream Askew_ is a game from a book containing two games the other titled _Dream Apart_. The title of this book is _Belonging Outside Belonging_. These two games were based on the same new game system introduced in this book called **no dice, no masters**, although the story game community most often refers to this system as **[BoB](/games/tags/BoB/)** (short for Belonging Outside Belonging). This system is heavily inspired by **[PbtA](/games/tags/PbtA/)** ( Powered by the Apocalypse ). _Dream Askew's_ setting is also inspired by _[Apocalypse World](/games/apocalypse-world/)_, it focuses on themes of violence, oppression and queer sexuality. The **[BoB](/games/tags/BoB/)** game system created for this game and _Dream Apart_ has been used in many other games. It's notable for being GMless and Diceless, hence the **no dice, no masters** moniker.
