_The Quiet Year_ is a [map making](/games/tags/mapmaking/), [world building](/games/tags/worldbuilding/) game. It's [GMless](/games/tags/gmless/) and uses [card](/games/tags/cards/) prompts to help you collectively tell a story about, and draw a map of a civilization that is ultimately doomed by the _Forst Shepherds_.
