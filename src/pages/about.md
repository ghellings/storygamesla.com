## About

***
### What we’re about
At Story Games LA we gather to play story games and indie role-playing games (RPGs). These games are similar to RPGs such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) but tend to be simpler to learn, and have more shared narrative control for all players.

### WHO IS THIS FOR?
Any experience level is welcome, with no prior knowledge required. Almost all games are meant to be played in a single night (sometimes called one-shots or episodic), so no regular attendance is necessary. Occasionally we create events for multi-session games, but these will be advertised as such (and even in multi-session games drop-ins may be allowed).

### WHAT GAMES DO WE PLAY?
 We play games that allow us to come together to have a good time telling a story collaboratively. We do not generally play games with a win condition. Some games we play have a game master (GM) and players, similar to D&D. Other games are “GM-less” or "GM-ful", and have no game master, where the rules of the game have us share narrative authority so we all have similar control over the story. Some examples include:

- Apocalypse World
- Blades in the Dark
- Dream Askew
- Fiasco
- For The Queen
- The Quiet Year
- Microscope


### WHAT GAMES DO WE AVOID?
We avoid role-playing games that may require players to have prior knowledge of rules (which is often the case with RPGs such as D&D). Many of us love board and card games, however this is not the event for those games. Note that some story games have elements that may look like board and card games, however we play games that share our goal of coming together to collaboratively tell a story. Although some board games have narrative elements (such as Above and Below), or can be played in a narrative manner (such as Arkham Horror), these do not meet our criteria. If you have any doubts, please talk to one of the organizers. It is also important that games played conform to our **[Community Standards](/standards/)**.

### WHERE AND WHEN IS THE EVENT?
Locations vary so check the meetup event for the current location. Some events are in-person / in real life (IRL), whereas some events are online. Check our event listing for details.

### HOW DO I ATTEND?
If you plan on attending, please RSVP here in meetup. You should not need to bring anything with you, however always feel free to bring writing utensils, dice, note cards, and so on.

### WHAT ARE THE RULES?
We try to provide an inclusive space, and do not tolerate harassment or prejudice of any kind, including that based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or disabilities. By attending and participating you are agreeing to abide by our **[Community Standards](/standards/)**. If you have any issues, please contact one of the meetup organizers at any time, either during the meetup or afterwards. We use the X-card and other RPG communication and safety tools, which we write about in our Community Standards document, and review when our events start.

### HOW CAN I RUN A GAME?
If you are new to the group and the events, we ask that you play the first few times to get a feel for the games we play, and for the environment and our community. If have done so, and wish to run a game, please get in touch with the meetup organizers either at the event, or in the **[Story Games LA Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qbPzyRYBQv)**.

### HOW CAN I BE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY?
The best place to participate with our community prior to or outside of the events is to join the **[Story Games LA Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qbPzyRYBQv)**. This is also where we sometimes host our online events.

_(In March 2024 the meetup name changed from Story Games Glendale to Story Games LA.)_
